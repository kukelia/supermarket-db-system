# supermarket-db-system
Desing and implementation of a Normalized database, and a python application interface with it  


### Main challenges overcomed:

* Designing Database from scratch (ERD and implementation)
* Grouping App interface's operations in Transactions, and committing them when all requirements were satisfied
* Making the app portable with docker to run in every device (soon)
